💊 Drugs Side Effects & Medical Condition Analysis

This repository presents an end-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding the relationship between drugs, their side effects, and associated medical conditions. It includes a complete workflow from exploratory data analysis to visualization of key patterns.

---
❓ Problem Statement

Drug safety is a major concern in healthcare. Patients often experience adverse side effects, and understanding these relationships can help improve treatment planning.  
This project aims to explore and analyze side effects reported for various drugs and map them to associated medical conditions using available dataset(s).

---
🎯 Project Objectives

- Analyze the frequency and distribution of side effects for different drugs  
- Identify common side effects and their corresponding conditions  
- Visualize correlations between drugs and adverse reactions  
- Provide data-driven insights for pharmaceutical safety evaluation

🧠 Drug Side Effects Analysis?

Drug side effect analysis involves studying reported adverse reactions for medications.  
By aggregating and visualizing this information, we can support healthcare providers and researchers in decision-making and risk mitigation.

---

🔍 Approach & Workflow

- Load and inspect the dataset  
- Handle missing values and clean data  
- Explore and visualize side effect patterns  
- Plot frequency of top side effects (e.g., Hives, Itching, Breathing difficulty)  
- Correlate side effects with associated conditions using visual analysis
